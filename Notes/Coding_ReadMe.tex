\textsc{Purpose of the note}:\\
This readme files documents the procedures and features of the MATLAB codes realted to the project \textit{Behavioural Epidemiology}. There are 4 files that is the key focus of this note:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Initialization Codes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{BE\_DataSetup.m}: Loads the dataset and initializes the fixed parameters
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textit{Estimation Codes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{BE\_EstimationCode.m}: The main file that invokes the estimation exercise
		\item \textbf{Objective\_Avec.m}: The objective function that describes the agent's problem for the estimation exercise
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textit{Simulation Codes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{BE\_SimulationCode.m}: This is the main file that invokes the simulation exercise
		\item \textbf{Objective\_Solve.m}: The objective function that solves the full problem for the simulation exercise
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
